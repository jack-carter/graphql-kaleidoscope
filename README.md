# GraphQL Kaleidoscope

This project is a collection of GraphQL implementations that illustrates the various ways GraphQL can be implemted using Node.js, along with the various libraries and frameworks that are available. Here is a list of the different approaches you will find in this repository:

* graphql library
* graphql-tools library
* graphql-nexus library
* Apollo Server

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local workstation for development and tewsting purposes. For specific notes on how to deploy any one of these solutions to a live system, we've created a separate section that describes each approach in turn.

### Installing Prerequisites

Although I have deliberately attempted to minimize the amount of global installs you will require, still there are some basic tools that I used, and I assume you will to. Here is a complete list of tools which you will need:

* nvm
* npm

#### Download Node Version Manager (nvm)

```
install nvm
```

#### Download Node Package Manager (npm)

```
install npm
```

## Installing the repository

## Verifying its running

This project uses three types of tests (1) end-to-end tests to ensure everything is running properly in preparation for a deployment, (2) unit tests to ensure the components which are supporting the end-to-end tests are working properly, and (3) coding style tests to ensure any code changes adhere to selected coding styles.
